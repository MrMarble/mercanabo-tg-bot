# [Guide] How to beat the stock (turnip) market playing Solo

Firstly this is not my finding but a translation of a Japanese wiki page that can be found [here!](https://w.atwiki.jp/doubutsunomori3ds/pages/99.html)

Apologies if this has been posted before as well

This is more for people who are not into staying in discord/forums to wait for people to admit them into high turnip selling stores. You can use this with TT or normal playing

Welcome to test it out as i am still testing myself

Basic knowledge:

- Turnips are bought on Sunday prices vary from 90~110
- The price of Turnips **for the week** is mostly determined by the price of Turnips **ON MONDAY MORNINGS**
- Turnip price changes **can** (not definite) happen in any time (morning and afternoon). The below will indicate price duration before the change as **intervals**

ok now to the actual guide

1) Take note of the buy price on Sunday and the sell price on Monday morning (Very important)

2) Main formula: Monday sell price ÷ Sunday Sale price = **X**

3) 5 possible outcomes from **X** is

* X ≥ 0.91: Type 1 or Type 4
* X ≥ 0.85 but < 0.91: Type 2, Type 3 or Type 4
* X ≥ 0.80 but < 0.85: Type 3 or Type 4
* X ≥ 0.60 but < 0.80: Type 1 or Type 4
* X < 0.60: Normally Type 4.

4) Types of patterns

**Type 1**: The Random. The pattern here is hard to grasp but it is also the only pattern that doesnt have a definite gradual decrease before *Spike*, the peak price will be between 1.1x~1.45x the buying price. Sell when it goes over the buy price.

**Type 2**: The worst. Prices will continue falling until next Monday (100% lose out)

**Type 3**: Prices will continue falling until *Spike* happens. After the spike the 2nd interval will be **more than** 1.4x bought price. 3rd interval after *Spike* will be the peak (sell here) prices between 2x~6x (best possible outcome)

**Type 4**: Prices will continue falling until *Spike* happens. After the spike the 2nd interval will be **less than** 1.4x bought price. 4th interval after *Spike* will be the peak, prices between 1.4x~2x

5) ***Spike*** (important). Spike means a sudden increase in price after following a decreasing pattern like type 2. After the spike we call that the 1st interval. The nature of the spike (whether it is a type 3 or 4) can be determined after the 2nd interval

**take not...it has been confirmed that the Spike will definitely be higher than the bought price**

For example

Prices gradually decreasing until Tuesday afternoon where a sudden *Spike* comes. This is the 1st interval. The price changed again Wednesday afternoon. This is the second interval (do the check of 1.4x here) if the price changes again on Friday Morning then thats the 3rd interval and again on Friday afternoon then that is the 4th interval.

**AFTER A SPIKE THE HIGHEST PRICE WILL ALWAYS BE AT THE 3RD OR 4TH INTERVAL AFTER THE SPIKE**

6) *Spikes* will **ONLY HAPPEN** Between Monday morning to Thursday afternoon. After Thursday afternoon, if there are no *Spike* then it will be confirmed as type 2 or type 1.

7) Never SELL right at the first or second interval AFTER THE SPIKE because they will NOT BE THE PEAK.

So thats the guide there if anyone want to use it! Testing results below:

I have tested it once and my friend did it as well and it seems to be quite accurate. (We dont TT so can only test this by weeks, welcome anyone to debunk or improve this)

Last week was accurate for me

Buy price 101. Monday morning 87 (87/101 = 86.13%) so so type 2,3 or 4. Prices continue to drop.

Spiked at Thursday afternoon (THANK GOD) from 74 -> 129, then Friday morning changed to 167 as the second interval (167/101 = 1.65 thus confirmed type 3). Then friday afternoon changed to third interval on a whooping 479!!!!

Friend's test:

bought 107, Monday morning price 98 (so 98/107 = 0.916 type 1 or 4), Tuesday Afternoon changed to 62, Wednesday morning changed to 91 (not downward pattern so possible spike?), Thursday changed to 73 (confirmed not a spike thus type 1), Friday changed to 139. Random pattern but a peak at 1.1x~1.45x buying price confirmed
